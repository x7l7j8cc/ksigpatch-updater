#= Where does it download the patches from?

The patches are download from my [patches repo](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches). These are automatically updated from the sources below.

The Atmosphere patches are downloaded from [this gbatemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/i-heard-that-you-guys-need-some-sweet-patches-for-atmosphere.521164/) which has proven to be the most trusted source for patches.

The Hekate / Kosmos patches are downloaded from the [latest github release from Joonie](https://github.com/Joonie86/hekate/releases).
